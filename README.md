RisingWave is a Postgres-compatible SQL database engineered to provide the <i><b>simplest</b></i> and <i><b>most cost-efficient</b></i> approach for <b>processing</b>, <b>analyzing</b>, and <b>managing</b> real-time event streaming data.

RisingWave can <b>ingest</b> millions of events per second, continuously <b>join and analyze</b> live data streams with historical tables, <b>serve</b> ad-hoc queries in real-time, and <b>deliver</b> fresh, consistent results wherever needed.

## Try it out in 60 seconds

Install RisingWave standalone mode:
```shell
curl https://risingwave.com/sh | sh
```

To learn about other installation options, such as using a Docker image, see [Quick Start](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/get-started/).

## When is RisingWave the perfect fit?
RisingWave is the ideal solution for:

* Managing real-time data sources like Kafka streams, database CDC, and more.
* Executing complex, on-the-fly queries, including joins, aggregations, and time windowing.
* Interactively and concurrently exploring consistent, up-to-the-moment results.
* Seamlessly delivering results to downstream systems.
* Processing both streaming and batch data with a unified codebase.


## In what use cases does RisingWave excel?
RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Streaming analytics**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Event-driven applications**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.
